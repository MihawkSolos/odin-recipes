        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. 
                Line bottom of pan with parchment paper and coat parchment with cooking
                 spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. In 
                another medium bowl, rub white sugar and lemon zest together with your hands until 
                well combined (sugar will start to turn yellow).</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat 10 
                tablespoons butter and the lemon zest mixture at medium speed until light 
                and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing at medium speed
                 and scraping bowl well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Mix in about one-third of flour mixture at low speed. Mix in 1/3 cup 
                sour cream. Scrape bowl well. Mix in another one-third of flour mixture,
                 then mix in 3 tablespoons lemon juice and remaining 1/3 cup sour cream.
                  Scrape bowl well. Mix in remaining one-third of flour mixture until incorporated 
                  and batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan and spread in an even layer. Bake until 
                cake springs back lightly when touched in center, 25 to 30 minutes. 
                Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
            <li>For frosting, put cream cheese and remaining 6 tablespoons butter in the
                 bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (bowl should be 
                 clean and dry). Beat at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes.
                  Gradually mix in 3/4 cup powdered sugar at medium speed until incorporated.</li>
            <li>With mixer running at medium speed, add whipping cream, 2 tablespoons 
                lemon juice, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt until fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>When cake is cool, run a small offset spatula around outside edge and 
                invert onto a cutting board. Spread frosting evenly over top of cake. 
                Loosely cover cake with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Use a long sharp knife to cut cake into 12 even rectangles. Line a 
                baking sheet with parchment paper; put a wire rack on baking sheet and
                 arrange cake pieces on rack.</li>
            <li>For glaze, whisk together milk, vanilla, and remaining 3 cups powdered 
                sugar and 5 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium bowl until a drizzly 
                glaze forms.</li>
            <li>Spoon glaze evenly over cake pieces, using offset spatula to spread 
                evenly and allowing excess to drip off sides.</li>
            <li>Gently slide offset spatula under each cake piece to transfer to an 
                airtight storage container. Chill until ready to serve 
                (or up to 4 days).</li>
        </ol>
