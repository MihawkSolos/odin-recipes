Created a website with recipes for different meals such as stuffed burgers, lemon fluff cake, and teriyaki ribs. 

# index.html file
My main file called index.html was simply used to show the different recipes available and provide a link to those recipes. 

# teriyaki-ribs.html
This file included a recipe to make teriyaki ribs which included a description, estimated time, ingredients and steps. 

# lemon-fluff-cake.html

# stuffed-burgers.html

All 3 of the recipe files are included in a recipe folder. The images of each of the final product of the recipes was stored and accessed from a folder called images within my main repository.
